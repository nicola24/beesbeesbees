// Create a Bee class, in pseudoclassical style, with:
var Bee = function() {
  // an age property that is set to 5
  this.age = 5;
  // a color property that is set to yellow
  this.color = yellow;
  // a food property that is inherited from grub
  this.food =

// an eat method that is inherited from grub
Bee.prototype.eat = function() {

};
// a job property that is set to keep on growing
Bee.prototype.job = function() {

};

// call the Grub superclass
// set the prototype
// set the constructor
